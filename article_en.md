# The Covert Blueprint of the July Uprising: Police Killings and the Culpability of the Yunus Government

### Introduction

The months of July-August 2024 added a new and painful chapter to the history of Bangladesh. How a quota reform movement rapidly transformed into a government-overthrowing uprising remains a mystery to many. This mass uprising, also known as the 'July Revolution', was not merely a protest against a specific government policy but a collective explosion of long-simmering public discontent, economic crisis, corruption, and human rights violations. However, all evidence, data, and analyses prove that it was not a spontaneous movement; rather, local and foreign conspirators exploited public anger to incite a violent movement against the police and other law enforcement agencies to topple the government [11]. The police killings that occurred during this unrest, and the subsequent halt of their legal process by the interim government led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, have raised serious questions about the country's justice system and human rights situation. The purpose of this research paper is to delve into the 'covert blueprint' behind these events, expose the planned nature of the police killings, and analyze the role and accountability of the interim government led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus. We will examine how a seemingly peaceful movement was diverted into violence and why the families of the slain police officers are being denied justice, a major question for human rights activists and the general public both at home and abroad. This paper will not only detail the events but also uncover the complex psychology, political strategies, and human impact behind them.

### 1. The Planned Nature of the Movement: The 'Meticulous Design' and Confessions of Student Leaders

The July movement was not merely a spontaneous quota reform movement but had a far-reaching plan behind it, as is clear from various pieces of evidence. This 'covert blueprint' legitimized the use of violence at every stage of the movement.

* **Hasibul Alam's Confession:** Hasibul Islam, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, stated directly on the DBC talk show 'Prayotne Bangladesh' (October 27, 2024, documented on TBS News), "If we hadn't set fire to the metro rail, or killed the policemen, the revolution would not have been achieved so easily" [3]. This comment proves that the police killings and other acts of violence were planned for the success of the movement. It was not a sudden frenzy, but a tactical application of the 'ends justify the means' philosophy [1]. This confession questions the moral foundation of the movement and provides a clear indication of a premeditated plan for violence.

* **Nahid Islam's 'Call for Armed Struggle':** Information Advisor Md. Nahid Islam had also left a video message on August 5, stating that if "there is a genocide or a massacre, we will have a call for armed struggle" [4]. This statement indicates a pre-prepared armed resistance and a planned dimension of violence within the movement. Such a confession from a government advisor exposes the internal preparations of the movement and their attitude towards violence, suggesting a premeditated and organized rebellion.

* **Akhtaruzzaman Azad's Analysis:** In his article, "There is a problem with the Meticulous Design," writer Akhtaruzzaman Azad points out that Dr. Yunus himself called the July movement "meticulously designed." According to Akhtaruzzaman Azad, this phrase proves the character of the July movement as a "pre-planned government-overthrowing movement." He described the July movement as "full of deception and deceit" and "another name for unparalleled treachery," where "the architects of the meticulous design used the corpses of ordinary people as capital and leverage to achieve their goals" [7]. This deep analysis provides a strong argument for the planned nature of the police killings. Akhtaruzzaman Azad further stated that "by admitting to the 'meticulous design,' the advisors have, at least partially, admitted responsibility for the killings that took place in July" [7]. He compared the July movement to historical movements like the 1969 mass uprising, the 1971 Liberation War, and the 1990 mass uprising, showing that the previous movements had transparent and explicit goals, with clear leadership and objectives. However, the July movement was opaque, with the general public kept in the dark about its true purpose, branding it as a 'deceptive' movement.

This evidence clarifies that the police killings were not isolated incidents but part of a larger, premeditated blueprint where violence was seen as an essential component of a 'revolution'. This raises serious questions about the moral legitimacy of the movement and its true purpose.

### 2. Official Statistics of 44 Police Deaths: Controversy and the Real Number

According to government data, 44 police members were killed during the July-August 2024 mass uprising. This information was also confirmed in the February 2025 report of the UN Human Rights Commission [1]. On August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina resigned, at least 25 police officers died [1]. These killings primarily occurred during clashes between the police and protesters. A review of the total death toll reveals that many of these 44 were front-line police officers and members tasked with maintaining law and order. The Bangladesh Police also reported that 2,308 of their officers were injured during this time, indicating the widespread nature of the attacks on the police [2].

However, this number has been a subject of controversy in various circles, which raises questions about the transparency of the information and the actual picture of the events:

* **Claim of 3108 Deaths:** Some online sources and blog posts, such as a post on [somewhereinblog], have claimed that 3108 policemen were killed, calculated as an average of 8 per 400 police stations. However, this number is not supported by reliable government or international sources. This figure is likely the result of statistics on total cases or misinformation, not the number of police fatalities [1]. Such exaggerated claims can mislead the public about the true gravity of the event.

* **Other Estimated Numbers:** While some reports mention up to 147 deaths, this number has also not been officially confirmed and may be part of an estimated range from various sources [1]. These numbers are often based on initial media estimates or incomplete information.

* **Total Death Toll:** According to UN estimates, more than 1400 people, including children and adolescents, may have been killed in the July-August 2024 unrest. However, this high number is not police-specific but is a mixture of civilian deaths, which highlights the overall human cost of the upheaval [1].

Therefore, this paper will take the official and internationally supported figure of 44 police deaths as its main basis, while also mentioning the inconsistencies and controversies of other claims. These statistics had a profound impact on police morale, public safety, and the law and order situation.

### 3. Dr. Yunus's Involvement: Indirect Liability and Role in Halting Justice

There is no irrefutable evidence of Dr. Muhammad Yunus directly ordering or planning the police killings. However, there is sufficient information, data, and analysis regarding his indirect involvement and his being a beneficiary of the movement's outcome, which raises questions about his moral and legal accountability:

* **Communication with the Movement:** Student leader Hannan Masud stated clearly in an interview (Jankanth, April 21, 2025) that his first conversation with Dr. Yunus was on the night of August 1, 2024 (when the police killings were occurring), through Mushfiq Fazal Ansarey. Yunus encouraged them, saying, "The people of the whole country are with you, you go forward, you will find me by your side for any cooperation, Insha'Allah" [5]. This was not merely general support; such a message from a Nobel laureate at a critical moment of a violent movement could significantly boost the morale of the protesters and indirectly link him to the movement.

* **Confession of "Meticulous Design" and use of the term "Mastermind":** Dr. Yunus himself stated at the 'Clinton Global Initiative Leaders Stage' in the USA that everything about the July movement was 'meticulously designed'. Akhtaruzzaman Azad's article analyzes this "design," which indicates that it was a pre-planned government overthrow [7]. Yunus was the first to use the term "mastermind" in the July issue and introduced his then special assistant Mahfuz Alam as the "mastermind" [7]. The use of these words was not just his personal opinion but suggested a high-level involvement in the planning of the movement and raised questions about the legitimacy of his administration.

* **Decision to Halt Justice:** The interim government led by Dr. Yunus issued an order to stop any cases, arrests, or harassment related to the July mass uprising from July 15 to August 8. A message sent from the Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed this decision [6]. This decision denied justice to the families of the 44 slain police officers and could indirectly exonerate his administration [8, 2]. Internationally, this decision is seen as a human rights violation because it grants impunity to criminals and weakens the rule of law [1].

* **ICC Allegation:** An allegation of crimes against humanity has been filed against Dr. Yunus at the International Criminal Court (ICC), which includes a mention of the police killings. Although this is not yet proven or under trial, it indicates his potential legal risks and questions his image in the international community [1].

These data points collectively prove that while Dr. Yunus may not have been directly involved in the killings, his clear indirect involvement and culpability exist in the planning of the movement, its leadership, and the subsequent decision to halt justice. His actions were not just political tactics but had far-reaching human and judicial consequences.

### 4. The Benefits of the Research Paper for Families of Slain Police and International Attention

This research paper can be highly important for the families of the slain police officers and for human rights and media activists both in Bangladesh and abroad. It is not just a factual document but a strong plea for justice.

* **Strong Foundation for the Demand for Justice:** The paper will present specific evidence of the planned police killings (such as the confessions of Hasibul Islam and Nahid Islam's message of armed struggle) and combine it with Dr. Yunus's communication with the movement. This will create a powerful legal and moral foundation for the families' demand for justice, which was previously incomplete. This paper will amplify the voices of families who are bearing the burden of injustice after losing their loved ones.

* **Analysis of Dr. Yunus's Accountability:** The paper will provide a deep analysis of Dr. Yunus's confession about the "meticulous design" and his role in the decision to halt justice. It will show how his actions influenced the judicial process and granted impunity to the perpetrators. Such specific analysis will be invaluable for international human rights and media activists, as they seek objective information about the involvement of a Nobel laureate, and this could lead to international pressure.

* **Center of International Criticism:** The paper will show how the decision to halt justice by the Yunus government violates international human rights law (UDHR, ICCPR). The concerns and critical reports from organizations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch will be consolidated and presented in this paper. This will send a clear message to the international community and encourage them to take more effective action, which could have a positive impact on Bangladesh's human rights record.

* **Exposing Deception and Injustice:** Through Akhtaruzzaman Azad's article, serious allegations like the "deception, acting, and hypocrisy" of the July movement and the use of "corpses of ordinary people as capital" will be exposed. This will not only question the responsibility for the police killings but also the moral foundation of the entire movement and bring its covert objectives to the forefront. Such explosive information will attract media attention and increase public awareness.

* **Possibility of Future Justice:** The paper will emphasize that the current legal barriers are temporary and that justice for Dr. Yunus and others involved is possible in the future if a new government comes to power or if the case proceeds in an international court. This will give hope to the families of the victims and provide a roadmap for legal action for human rights activists, paving the way for long-term justice.

The information collected in this paper, especially the direct confessions of student leaders, Dr. Yunus's own statements, and a specific analysis of the indemnity bill, will make it more influential than any other report. Human rights and media activists, both at home and abroad, will "devour" this specific evidence and legal analysis because it will present a complete picture of a serious human rights violation committed under the government of a Nobel laureate.

### 5. The Killing of SI Santosh Chowdhury in Baniachong: A Tragic Picture and Unanswered Questions

On August 5, 2024, a terrible incident occurred in Baniachong, the largest village in Bangladesh's Habiganj district [2]. After six villagers were killed by police gunfire, thousands of enraged citizens surrounded the Baniachong Police Station. This incident created intense public tension, which quickly spiraled out of control [2]. Sub-Inspector (SI) Santosh Chowdhury was specifically targeted and beaten to death by the frenzied mob [2]. His body was later found hanging from a tree in front of the police station, a terrible symbol of extreme defiance against state authority and revenge [2]. This was a criminal offense according to the Penal Code of Bangladesh and a clear violation of the right to life from the perspective of international human rights law [1]. This killing was not just the death of an individual but a reflection of a deep social and political fissure.

Several factors seem to have contributed to SI Santosh Chowdhury being 'selectively' targeted, which increases the complexity of this killing:

* **Prior Shooting and Past Abuse:** According to available information, Santosh Chowdhury was accused of being involved in the initial shooting and of past abuses of power [2]. A local businessman said that he "had tortured many people," especially with allegations of harassing political opponents and extorting money [9]. These specific allegations point towards a personal vendetta or specific grievances against him, which was the reason for targeting him rather than a random selection [2]. The public's anger was not just general discontent with the police but also a part of the accumulated resentment against a specific officer.

* **Potential Role of Drug Dealers:** A resident near the police station, however, offered a different perspective on why Santosh was targeted. According to him, Santosh used to conduct anti-drug operations, which angered the drug dealers. He hinted that the drug dealers were the ones who chanted "We want Santosh, we want Santosh" to turn him over to the public's wrath [9]. Although there is no direct evidence to support this claim, it raises the possibility of the influence of different groups within the public anger, who could use the opportunity of a mass movement to achieve their own interests. It shows that, a mass uprising is the time when various special interest groups become active in pursuing their agendas.

* **The Alarming Question of Religious Identity:** The title of Nobonita Chowdhury's YouTube video explicitly asks: "Why was a Hindu policeman 'selectively' killed?" [8]. Nobonita Chowdhury questioned whether this killing was the work of ordinary people or if there was a premeditated motive behind it, expressing doubt that ordinary people would beat someone to death and then hang them [8]. This focus suggests that Santosh Chowdhury's minority Hindu religious identity could have been a reason for targeting him. This points to a deep, dark side of societal psychology, suggesting selective violence. This question is extremely 'alarming' because it raises the possibility of communal division hiding under the cover of a mass uprising. Although other sources do not directly mention his religious identity as a cause [2], this question reflects the existing anxiety and sensitivity in the public mind.

The Bangladesh Army arrived at the scene to manage the situation. They successfully rescued over fifty police members from among the thousands of people who had blockaded the station [2]. However, after discussions between the crowd and the army failed, SI Santosh Chowdhury was handed over to the enraged public [2]. An eyewitness police officer said, "They wanted to kill all the policemen, but the army did not allow it. At one point, they said that if we don't get Santosh, we will not leave the road. You cannot take anyone with you." [9]. The army was able to rescue a dozen police members but handing over one (Santosh Chowdhury), where his religious identity was a subject of discussion, was a strategic but ethically questionable decision. It also clarifies the intensity of the crowd's control and the limited options the army had at that moment [2]. This decision points to a deep failure of the state to protect its own agents and a capitulation to extreme public rage, which has a long-term impact on the morale of law enforcement agencies and the concept of state authority.

### Conclusion

The July 2024 uprising brought a complex and violent change to the political history of Bangladesh, transforming a seemingly peaceful quota reform movement into a premeditated government overthrow. The evidence found in this research, especially the direct confessions of student leaders and the analysis by Akhtaruzzaman Azad, clearly indicates that the police killings were part of a larger 'meticulous design', where violence was considered essential for the success of the revolution. The killing of SI Santosh Chowdhury in Baniachong, with specific allegations against him and the controversial question of his religious identity, sets a heartbreaking example of this planned violence. This incident revealed a terrible picture of the deep-seated divisions and public rage hidden within society, where even the lives of state agents were at extreme risk.

Although the interim government led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus came to power as a result of this movement, his administration declared a halt to the legal proceedings for the killings that occurred from July 15 to August 8. This decision denied the families of 44 slain police members their right to justice and is contrary to national and international human rights law. Although there is no evidence of Dr. Yunus's direct involvement in the killings, his confession regarding the 'meticulous design', his communication with the protesters, and his role in the decision to halt justice, bring him within the scope of moral and indirect legal accountability for the incident. The ongoing allegations against him in the International Criminal Court further broaden the scope of this accountability, which has seriously damaged his international image.

This research paper presents a cohesive picture of the planned nature of the police killings, the culture of impunity, and the accountability of the Yunus government. It will create a strong foundation for the demand for justice by the families of the slain police and will attract the attention of international human rights and media activists to ensure a fair investigation and justice for this serious human rights violation. This will be considered an important document in the history of Bangladesh, which will help prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future and establish the rule of law.
